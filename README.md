# ECG-Based Authentication Interface with Fiducial and Non-Fiducial Features

Welcome to the ECG-Based Authentication Interface project! This project aims to provide a novel and secure authentication system using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Unlike traditional authentication methods that rely on passwords or fingerprints, ECG offers a unique and robust biometric characteristic that can be used for user identification.

## Overview

The ECG-Based Authentication Interface utilizes both fiducial and non-fiducial features extracted from ECG signals to establish a highly accurate and reliable authentication system. Fiducial features are specific points in the ECG waveform, such as R-peaks, P-waves, and T-waves, while non-fiducial features encompass a broader range of signal characteristics like heart rate variability, QRS complex width, and more.
